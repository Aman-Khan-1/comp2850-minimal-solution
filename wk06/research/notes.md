## Participant A
**Date**: [2025/11/25 16:14]
**Context** [partially sighted, dark screen, big and clear fonts, needs text-to-speech features]
**Consent**: Confirmed verbally
**Duration** [~12 minutes]


### Q1: Could you briefly tell me about the last time you used a to-do list or some sort of task manager.
**Response**: "Last time I used my to-do app was just this morning and the app I use is called "Todoist". I usually do it to balance my family plans alongside work deadlines. For instance I set reminders for my daughter's swimming lesson and for an email I needed to send out before noon. The app keeps me on track, so I don't forget anything important." 

**Observations**
- Balancing different tasks (personal and work related)
- Reliance on reminders
- Trust in the tool (Prevents forgetfulness)

**Themes**: 'reminder_dependence', 'multi_context', 'balance'

### Q2: So then what is most frustrating when you are managing tasks? Can you also specify with an example, doesn't have to be a long one. 
**Response**: "The most frustrating thing for me is when the app isn't fully accessible. For example, occasionally I struggle with apps that make menus or icons too tiny or don't have voice navigation options. I really wish they could just add some simple, clear layouts and some adjustable font sizes so it can be better. I mean some of the fonts are okay, but others are very small, so just need to fix that."

**Observations**:
- Special needs required (accessibility barriers)
- Frustration explicilly mentioned, negativity shown (user experience)
- Lack of voice navigation (Missing features)

**Themes**: 'emotional_response', 'accesibility_requirements', 'voice_feature'

---

### Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task, and what really happened during that time?
**Response**: "A while back I have. I forgot to add my son's parent-teacher meeting to the app. I completely missed it because it wasn't written down anywhere, and I only realised when I found the reminder letter a week later. From that point on, I started immediately inputting events or tasks into the app as soon as I knew about them."

**Observations**:
- Heavy reliance on external reminders
- Behaviour change (new habit of immediately doing things)
- Consequence - missed meeting (high impact)

**Themes**: 'app_dependency', 'proactive_habit', 'missed_event'

### Q4: Do you work without a mouse?
**Response**: "Sometimes I work without a mouse. Since i'm partially sighted, I often rely on keyboard shortcuts or voice commands to navigate apps and websites because it is faster and easier than trying to track the cursor all the time."

**Observations**:
- Reliant on other features (shortcuts/voice)
- Accessibility need (partial-sighted)
- Curser tracking difficulty (mouse pointer hard to track)

**Themes**: 'partial_sight', 'accessibility_adaptation', 'cursor_difficulty'

### Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight. This seems a bit unusual I know but maybe there have been times when you were working when there was sunlight. If you did what was hard about it?
**Response**: "I've definitely used my task manager outside in bright sunlight. Bright sunlight can make it hard to see the screen clearly, especially with the high contrast modes or when the brightness is high. Sometimes I do use voice commands to create tasks when I am too tired to focus on the screen or just multitasking like cooking. Without voice feedback though, assigning tasks with my eyes closed, that wouldn't work for me at all."
**Observations**:
- Brightness and environmental light 
- Voice input (alternative to the screen)
- Multitasking needs (such as cooking, not visually engaged)

**Themes**: 'environmental_light', 'input_alternatives', 'accessibility_multitasking'

### Q6: If there was one feature you could add to make task management feel less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**: "If I could add just one feature, it would be intelligent prioritisation. This is an app that can suggest what tasks to focus on based on deadlines or importance. If you can also add clear visual or audio cues along with it, I believe it could make managing tasks so much smoother."
**Observations**:
- Desire for intelligent prioritisation
- Need for guidance cues
- Focus on deadlines and importance 

**Themes**: 'automation_intelligence', 'accessibility_requirements, 'deadline_focus'



## Participant B
**Date**: [2025-9/25 14:35]
**Context**: [e.g., Uses keyboard only, prefers dark mode, has ADHD]
**Consent**: Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response: "I use Notion for uni work. Last week I had to find all tasks tagged 'COMP2850' to prepare for a deadline. It took ages because the filter kept resetting."

**Observations**: 
- Mentioned filter UX issue (cognitive load)
- Time pressure context (deadline stress)
- Tag-based workflow (not just chronological)

**Themes**: 'filter_persistence', 'cognitive_load', 'deadline_anxiety'

---

### Q2: What fustrates you?
**Response: "When I submit a form and nothing happens-like, did it save? I have to refresh the whole page to check."

**Observations**:
- Lack of confirmation feedback
- Low trust in interface
- Workaround = page reload (inefficient)

**Themes**: 'status_feedback', 'confirmation', 'trust'

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Yeah, I once forgot to submit coursework because it was buried in my list. I wish there was a way to pin urgent things."

**Observations**:
- List length issue (visibility)
- Prioritisation need
- Consequence = missed deadline (high impact)

**Themes**: 'prioritisation', 'visibility', 'urgent_tasks'

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "My trackpad broke last month. I tried using Tab to navigate, but some buttons were impossible to reach. Had to borrow a friend's mouse."

**Observations**:
-Keyboard-only experience = friction
- Temporary impairment (broken hardware)
- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: 'keyboard_nav', 'temporary_impairment', 'button_accessibility'

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "Haven't tried eyes closed, but in sunlight I can't read low-contrast text. I increase zoom but then the layout breaks."

**Observations**:
- Contrast issue (situational disability)
- Zoom breaks responsive design
- Environmental factor (sunlight)

**Themes**: 'contrast', 'zoom', 'responsive_design'

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "A way to see progress-like, 'You've completed 8 out of 12 tasks this week.' That would motivate me."

**Observations**:
- Motivation through feedback
- Progress visualisation
- Weekly scope (not just daily)

**Themes**: 'progress_tracking', 'motivation', 'feedback'

---

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Filter resets -> cognitive overload 
2. No confirmation feedback -> uncertainty
3. Keyboard navigation gaps -> temporary exclusion
4. Contrast issues in bright light -> situational disability
